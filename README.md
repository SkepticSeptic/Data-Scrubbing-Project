# What is this project?

This is a project for AP Computer Science Principles. The instructions it was based off are as follows:

You have been asked to write a data cleaning function, clean_up_data(list, value). Your function must take two parameters: a list and a value to remove. The purpose of the function is to "clean" the data by removing all instances of the value from the list while providing updates on list size before and after as well as verification that the list does still contain at least one valid data value. Follow these steps for the function:

1. display (print) the text label: “Before cleaning size: ” and the number of elements in the list before cleaning
2. display (print) the original list
3. using selection and iteration, remove the provided value from the list every time it is found
4. display (print) the cleaned list
5. display (print) the text label: “After cleaning: ” and the number of elements in the list after cleaning
6. display (print) the first element in the list and a count of the number of times the first list element occurs in the list overall (including the first time)

Please use the included function calls to test your solution.
